## Branching Stratergies to be used
  ### Project 1: Only Main Branch is needed, therefore I won't be using any branching stratergy.
      *Main
  
  ### Project 2: For this Project I will be using a branching stratergy known as GitHub Flow. I will be creating a few features as well and then merged them back into       Main. I will use the Hotfix branch to solve the bugs that I might run into.
      *Main
      *Feature
      *Hotfix  
      
   ### Project 3: For this Project I will be using a branching stratergy known as GitHub Flow. I will be creating a few features as well and then merged them back into       Main. I will use the Hotfix branch to solve the bugs that I might run into.

 ## The use of a .gitignore file within each project
   For projects 2,3,4, and 5, I will create a .gitignore file which will store all the files I do not want appearing in my git repository

 ## Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information
  The storage of credentials and sensitive info will be done on Azure
