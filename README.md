## Branching Stratergies to be used
 I will make use of a Branching Stratergy known as GitHub Flow.
 I will create the main branch and then proceed to creating new branches that I will be working in such as feature branches that stem directly from the master, and then merged back into main.

 ## The use of a .gitignore file within each project
   For projects 2,3,4, and 5, I will create a .gitignore file which will store all the files I do not want appearing in my git repository

 ## Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information
  The storage of credentials and sensitive info will be done on Azure
